# Learning-Deep-Learning
A repository containing tutorials and examples that I have gone through in exploring deep learning

## [MNIST in Tensorflow](https://github.com/brianhhu/Learning-Deep-Learning/blob/master/MNIST%20in%20Tensorflow.ipynb)
A simple example of using Tensorflow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. We begin with a simple 1-layer fully-connected network, and expand to using deep convolutional neural networks. In the process, we explore different optimization techniques (gradient descent vs. Adam), and also useful tricks such as learning rate decay and dropout. We achieve a final test accuracy greater than 99%.
